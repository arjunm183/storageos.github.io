# StorageOS Documentation

StorageOS enables persistent storage for containers. It allows developers to
build stateful containerized apps.

StorageOS is available from the Docker Hub as a volume plugin (for Docker 1.13+)
or as a container image (Docker 1.10+ or Kubernetes 1.7+).

The StorageOS container must run on every node in a cluster and requires a
64-bit Linux host.
